# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# SpaceX Info Project

Excited to share my recent ReactJS project SpaceX Info! I'm thrilled to showcase my latest ReactJS project that I've been working on for the past few days. ðŸŽ‰ The goal was to create a dynamic and user-friendly web application.

## Tech Stack

- **ReactJS**: The core of the application, allowing for efficient and seamless rendering of components.
- **Redux Toolkit**: For state management, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase as the project grows.
- **Tailwind CSS**: This powerful utility-first CSS framework allowed us to create a beautiful and responsive design with ease.
- **SpaceX API**: I have integrated the SpaceX API to fetch real-time data and provide the latest information.
- **Vercel**: I deployed the application on Vercel, a fantastic platform that ensures high performance and reliability.

This project boasts some impressive features like fetching data about SpaceX Rockets, Capsules, Crew, Missions, etc.

## Features

- Real-time data from SpaceX API.
- Information about Rockets, Capsules, Crew, Missions, etc.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout this project, I gained invaluable insights into ReactJS best practices, state management, and the benefits of using CSS frameworks. Additionally, integrating with external APIs like SpaceX's taught me valuable skills in handling data from third-party sources and presenting it in an intuitive manner.
